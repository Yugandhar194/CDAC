       It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a
       disciplined life, they set an easy path to success. They will develop an approach to 
       happiness and a beautiful future ahead. Being disciplined is the practice of having a 
       scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working.
       An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young.
       Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages og a disciplined life 
       make it a worthwhile endeavour.
