            Sounds of Change passes on music as a tool to aid-workers, psychologists, teachers, therapists and musicians who work in locations in the world where people have become alienated from themselves and from each other. 

            We see our trainees as changemakers. People who use music as a means of connecting, supporting and transforming the lives of people, in places such as refugee camps, asylum-seeker centres, deprived areas and (former) war zones.</p>

            <h3>Gift Card</h3>
            <p>
                A string of scams are taking place, in which people are asked to make payments over the phone for things such as taxes, hospital bills, bail money, debt collection and utility bills. The scams are carried out using many methods, including gift cards. As the fraudsters are sometimes requesting codes from App Store & iTunes Gift Cards or Apple Store Gift Cards, we want to make sure our customers are aware of these scams.

                Regardless of the reason for payment, the scam follows a certain formula: The victim receives a call instilling panic and urgency to make a payment by purchasing App Store & iTunes Gift Cards or Apple Store Gift Cards from the nearest retailer (convenience store, electronics retailer etc.). After the cards have been purchased, the victim is asked to pay by sharing the code(s) on the back of the card with the caller over the phone.
